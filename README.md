# NeRF-reproduce

A repo to reproduce NeRF.

## TODO

- [x] Build model and implement positional encoding( `model.py` )
- [ ] Prepare and transform dataset( `datasets.py` )
- [ ] Batchify the input rays
- [ ] Transform the output of neural network to rgb color and weight.
- [ ] Hierarchical Sampling
